# Git Cleanup Instructions

## The Problem
Your git push was rejected because GitHub's secret scanning detected an OpenAI API key in your commit history. This creates a security risk.

## Immediate Steps

1. **Revoke your API key in the OpenAI dashboard**
   - Go to https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys
   - Find the key that was leaked and delete it
   - Create a new key if needed

2. **Remove the API key from your local code**
   - This has been done by replacing the hardcoded key with an environment variable approach
   - Updated .gitignore to prevent future key leaks

## Clean Up Git History

### Option 1: Using the batch file (Windows)
1. Run the `clean_git_history.bat` file we created 

### Option 2: Manual commands

```bash
# Remove the API key from git history
git filter-branch --force --index-filter "git rm --cached --ignore-unmatch 3.5finetuning.py" --prune-empty --tag-name-filter cat -- --all

# Clean up the repository
git reflog expire --expire=now --all
git gc --aggressive --prune=now

# Force push to remote
git push --force origin main
```

## Using Environment Variables

With the updated code, you need to set the OPENAI_API_KEY environment variable:

### For Windows:
```
set OPENAI_API_KEY=your_new_api_key_here
```

### For macOS/Linux:
```
export OPENAI_API_KEY=your_new_api_key_here
```

### For permanent setup:
- Add the environment variable to your system settings
- Or create a `.env` file (which is now gitignored) and load it in your code

## Future Best Practices
1. Never hardcode API keys or secrets
2. Use environment variables for sensitive information
3. Setup a pre-commit hook to catch secrets before they get committed
4. Consider using a secret management tool
